# JWT Authentication System

## Description
This project, JWT Authentication System, implements a secure JWT authentication mechanism using Django and Django Rest Framework on the backend. For the frontend, it utilizes React and Vite to provide a smooth user experience. This system ensures that users can securely access resources and services, thanks to the robust security protocols in place.

## Installation
To set up the JWT Authentication System, follow these steps:

### Backend
1. **Install Django**:
    ```bash
    pip install django
    ```

2. **Install Django Rest Framework**:
    ```bash
    pip install djangorestframework
    ```

3. **Set up the Django project**:
    ```bash
    django-admin startproject jwt_authenticon
    cd jwt_authenticon
    django-admin startapp authentication
    ```

4. **Configure the settings**: Add `rest_framework` and your app to `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`.

5. **Set up the URLs**: Add the routes for your authentication endpoints in `urls.py`.

6. **Run the server**:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

### Frontend
1. **Install Node.js and npm** (if not already installed):
    [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

2. **Set up a new React project** with Vite:
    ```bash
    npm create vite@latest my-app --template react
    cd my-app
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the React app**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Usage

To demonstrate how to use the JWT Authentication System, follow these examples:

1. **Register a New User**:
    - Send a POST request to the `/register/` endpoint with the user's details:
    ```bash
    POST /register/
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        "username": "newuser",
        "password": "newpassword"
    }
    ```

2. **Obtain JWT Token**:
    - Send a POST request to the `/api/token/` endpoint with the user's credentials to receive a JWT token:
    ```bash
    POST /api/token/
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        "username": "newuser",
        "password": "newpassword"
    }
    ```

3. **Access Protected Resources**:
    - Use the JWT token to access protected resources by including it in the Authorization header:
    ```bash
    GET /protected-resource/
    Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token
    ```

4. **Refresh JWT Token**:
    - Send a POST request to the `/api/token/refresh/` endpoint with the refresh token to obtain a new JWT token:
    ```bash
    POST /api/token/refresh/
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        "refresh": "your_refresh_token"
    }
    ```

## Features
- **User Registration**: Secure user registration with validation and encryption.
- **Token-Based Authentication**: Generate and validate JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication.
- **Protected Routes**: Restrict access to certain endpoints based on user authentication status.
- **Token Refresh**: Ability to refresh JWT tokens for continuous authentication.
- **User Role Management**: Assign roles and permissions to users for granular access control.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for scalability and performance optimization.
